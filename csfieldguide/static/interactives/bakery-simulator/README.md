## The interactive

The user is tasked with baking a cake for a customer.
There are 3 customers in total: the first gives the least helpful answers, the second gives somewhat helpful answers, and the third gives very helpful information along with a lot of extraneous information.
Once the cake has been constructed, the user receives feedback through the form of a score on how close their cake was to the one the customer wanted.
