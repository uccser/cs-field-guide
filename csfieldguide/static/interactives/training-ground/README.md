This interactive demonstrates how an AI makes decisions through a neural network.

## The game

The goal of the game is to pick up the final stick from a pile.
The player and AI (Nathaniel) will alternate picking up between 1 and 3 sticks.
At the conclusion of the game, Nathaniel will update its neural network based on the moves it made and the result of the game.
Its neural network can be seen by the player on the right side of the screen.
