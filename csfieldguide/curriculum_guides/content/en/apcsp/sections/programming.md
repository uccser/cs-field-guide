# Programming

## Overview

- EU 5.1 Programs can be developed for creative expression, to satisfy personal curiosity, to create new knowledge, or to solve problems (to help people, organizations, or society).
- EU 5.2 People write programs to execute algorithms.
- EU 5.3 Programming is facilitated by appropriate abstractions.
- EU 5.4 Programs are developed, maintained, and used by people for different purposes.
- EU 5.5 Programming uses mathematical and logical concepts.

## Reading from the Computer Science Field Guide

Start by reading through:

- [Programming Languages]('chapters:chapter' 'programming-languages')
- [Software Engineering]('chapters:chapter' 'software-engineering')
- [Human Computer Interaction]('chapters:chapter' 'human-computer-interaction')

The AP CSP framework does not require a specific programming language but does require students to learn programming.
