- EK 1.2.1B Creating computational artifacts requires understanding of and use of software tools and services.
- EK 1.2.1C Computing tools and techniques are used to create computational artifacts and can include, but are not limited to, programming integrated development environments (IDEs), spreadsheets, 3D printers, or text editors.
- EK 1.2.1D A creatively developed computational artifact can be created by using nontraditional, nonprescribed computing techniques.

- EK 1.2.3A Creating computational artifacts can be done by combining and modifying existing artifacts or by creating new artifacts.
- EK 1.2.3B Computation facilitates the creation and modification of computational artifacts with enhanced detail and precision.
- EK 1.2.3C Combining or modifying existing artifacts can show personal expression of ideas.

### LO 1.2.4 Collaborate in the creation of computational artifacts.

- EK 1.2.4A A collaboratively created computational artifact reflects effort by more than one person.
- EK 1.2.4B Effective collaborative teams consider the use of online collaborative tools.
- EK 1.2.4C Effective collaborative teams practice interpersonal communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, and negotiation.
- EK 1.2.4D Effective collaboration strategies enhance performance.
- EK 1.2.4E Collaboration facilitates the application of multiple perspectives (including sociocultural perspectives) and diverse talents and skills
in developing computational artifacts.
- EK 1.2.4F A collaboratively created computational artifact can reflect personal expressions of ideas.

### LO 1.2.5 Analyze the correctness, usability, functionality, and suitability of computational artifacts.

- **EK 1.2.5A The context in which an artifact is used determines the correctness, usability, functionality, and suitability of the artifact.**
- **EK 1.2.5B A computational artifact may have weaknesses, mistakes, or errors depending on the type of artifact.**
- **EK 1.2.5C The functionality of a computational artifact may be related to how it is used or perceived.**
- **EK 1.2.5D The suitability (or appropriateness) of a computational artifact may be related to how it is used or perceived.**

- EK 1.3.1A Creating digital effects, images, audio, video, and animations has transformed industries.
- EK 1.3.1B Digital audio and music can be created by synthesizing sounds, sampling existing audio and music, and recording and manipulating sounds, including layering and looping.
- EK 1.3.1C Digital images can be created by generating pixel patterns, manipulating existing digital images, or combining images.
- EK 1.3.1D Digital effects and animations can be created by using existing software or modified software that includes functionality to implement the effects and animations.
