# Algorithms

{comment explain different views of algorithm (programming context) and Algorithm (that have interesting complexity); use https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hfOvs8pY1k for the former?}

Every computer device you have ever used, from your school computers to your calculator, has been using {glossary-link term="algorithm"}algorithms{glossary-link end} to tell it how to do whatever it was doing.
Algorithms are a very important topic in Computer Science because they help software developers create efficient and error free {glossary-link term="program"}programs{glossary-link end}.
The most important thing to remember about algorithms is that there can be many different algorithms for the same problem, but some are much better than others!
