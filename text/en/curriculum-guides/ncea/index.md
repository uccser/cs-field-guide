These assessment guides have been written to assist teachers and students
for the following NCEA Achievement Standards:

A new curriculum for NCEA Digital Technologies is planned on being rolled out from 2018 onwards.
This will require changes for these guides, so please stay tuned for updates.

The computer science externals can be particularly time consuming for Merit and Excellence.
For some students, it is better to just focus on doing the Achieved material well.
For this reason, we provide separate guides for students aiming for subject endorsement and for students aiming to get the credits.

These guides are still a work in progress.

We recommend reading the guidance on this page very carefully to ensure students are working on the right material.
There is also a lot of material available online from NZQA, and good ideas shared on the [NZACDITT](http://nzacditt.org.nz/) mailing list.
