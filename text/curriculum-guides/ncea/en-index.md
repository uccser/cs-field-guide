# NCEA Curriculum Guides

These curriculum guides have been written to assist teachers and students
for the following NCEA Achievement Standards:
- AS91074 (1.44)
- AS91371 (2.44)
- AS91636 (3.44)

The computer science externals can be particularly time consuming for Merit/ Excellence.
For some students, it is better to just focus on doing the Achieved material well.
For this reason, we provide separate guides for students aiming for subject endorsement and for students aiming to get the credits.

*Note: These guides are still a work in progress.*
*We recommend reading the guidance on this page very carefully to ensure students are working on the right material.
There is also a lot of material available online from NZQA, and good ideas shared on the [NZACDITT](http://nzacditt.org.nz/) mailing list.*

## AS91074 (1.44)

1.44 covers three topics: Algorithms, Programming Languages, and Human Computer Interaction. For Merit and Excellence, we provide separate guides for each topic. For Achieved, all the topics are in a single document, and a writing frame with a recommended layout and some useful sentence starters is also provided.

- [Level 1 Introduction](curriculum-guides/ncea/assessment-guide-level-1-introduction.html)

This guide will be added to the field guide in early 2016.

- [Guide for Achieved in 1.44](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A5x-0sbcH-73orZCIlci0CqqxQzGKCbija3z0KsIDEE/)
- [Writing Frame](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e41Cb50tvnjBWWPwIy3bY5CrymUK3ZJ4nnFnyRQqC2U/edit#)

The guide contains a check list at the end which students can use to check off things as they do them, and to ensure they do not miss anything.

### Algorithms

The following guides are for students who are aiming for Merit or Excellence.

- [Algorithms - Searching (Merit/ Excellence)](curriculum-guides/ncea/assessment-guide-level-1-searching-algorithms.html)
- [Algorithms - Sorting (Merit/ Excellence)](curriculum-guides/ncea/assessment-guide-level-1-sorting-algorithms.html)

### Programming Languages

- [Programming Languages (Merit/ Excellence)](curriculum-guides/ncea/assessment-guide-level-1-programming-languages.html)

### Human Computer Interaction

- [Human Computer Interaction (Merit/ Excellence)](curriculum-guides/ncea/assessment-guide-level-1-human-computer-interaction.html)

## AS91371 (2.44)

[Level 2 Introduction](curriculum-guides/ncea/assessment-guide-level-2-introduction.html)

For 2.44, students will need to do **one** project on data representation (each data representation guide contains two data types), **three** projects for encoding, and **one** project for human computer interaction. They must do one encoding project for each of the three encoding areas - compression, error control coding, and encryption.

The guides the student picks will depend on whether they are aiming for Merit/ Excellence, or on just getting the credits.  Note that Merit/ Excellence for this standard requires time, commitment and a willingness to do additional reading.

### Representing Data

Students will need to pick **one** project from here. Which they pick will depend on whether they are aiming for Merit/ Excellence or Achieved. Each guide fully covers the requirements for Representing Data at the chosen level.

**Achieved Guides**

- For Achieved: [Representing Data - Representing numbers and text with bits (Achieved)](curriculum-guides/ncea/assessment-guide-level-2-achieved-representing-data.html)

**Merit/ Excellence Guides**

Not yet released - check back in early 2016.

{comment end}

### Encoding

**For Achieved**, students need to pick **three Achieved projects** with one from each of the three encoding topics (giving a total of 3 encoding projects)

**For Merit/ Excellence**, students need to pick **one Excellence project** from one of the three encoding topics, and **two Achieved projects**; with one from each of the other two encoding topics (giving a total of 3 encoding projects).

Note that we are currently updating Merit/ Excellence guides to better match the expectations for students working at these levels. The updated guides will be released in check back in early 2016.
