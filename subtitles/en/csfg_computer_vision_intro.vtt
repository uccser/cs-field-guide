00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Computer Vision
The idea of a computer being able to see

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
is no longer science fiction.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.400
There are good methods available for recognising
where a face is in an image, or even who it might be.

00:11.400 --> 00:13.000
Recognising where abjects are in a scene

00:13.000 --> 00:16.400
makes it possible to navigate vehicles without
bumping into anything.

00:16.400 --> 00:22.200
That's especially important for things like
wheelchairs, robots or even a self-driving car.

00:22.200 --> 00:25.800
Analysing objects enables a system
to detect interesting features,

00:25.800 --> 00:30.200
such as the quality of fruit being packed.

00:31.800 --> 00:35.200
Or even a tumour in a medical scan.

00:35.200 --> 00:39.400
In this chapter, you'll look at Computer Vision
methods for things like:

00:39.400 --> 00:42.600
finding the edges around objects;

00:42.600 --> 00:45.400
recognising faces;

00:45.400 --> 00:48.000
recognising characters;

00:54.000 --> 00:57.600
and tracking objects moving through a scene.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.400
