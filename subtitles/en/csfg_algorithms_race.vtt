00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Algorithms

00:02.000 --> 00:02.000
We use computers to do hundreds
of different tasks every day:

00:05.400 --> 00:10.200
Things like searching the internet;
editing an image; or finding a route on a map.

00:10.200 --> 00:13.600
But have you ever wondered how a computer
figures out how to do these things?

00:13.600 --> 00:18.400
An algorithm is a step-by-step process
which tells a computer how to do a specific task.

00:18.400 --> 00:21.200
But there can be many different
algorithms for the same problem,

00:21.200 --> 00:24.400
kind of like how there can be many
different recipies for baking a cake.

00:24.400 --> 00:27.400
But as we know,
some recipies can be a lot better than others.

00:27.400 --> 00:31.400
So we're going to do a little experiment
to see if the same thing is true for algorithms.

00:31.400 --> 00:34.600
Here we are in front of
the University of Canterbury Library.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.000
About to start the great algorithms race.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.800
Competing today we have:
Speedy Spencer, and Slowcoach Slade.

00:43.800 --> 00:46.600
Their task is to run to the library,
and find this book by Knuth

00:46.600 --> 00:50.400
amongst the millions of books in there.
First one to find it wins.

00:50.400 --> 00:55.600
Are you ready? Go!

00:58.600 --> 01:02.000
Spencer!

01:07.200 --> 01:11.600
Speedy Spencer is off to a flying start;
he's searched dozens of books already.

01:11.600 --> 01:15.400
He seems to be employing a Sequencial Search
algorithm, so he looks at the first book,

01:15.400 --> 01:19.000
and then continues on and looks at each
individual book until he...

01:19.000 --> 01:21.800
Where's he going?

01:21.800 --> 01:26.600
He seems to know exactly what he's looking for.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.400
Slade seems to be employing something like a
Binary Search algorithm as his strategy.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.600
He's looked at a book at the center of the library,
and by looking at that one book,

01:46.600 --> 01:49.600
he's realised that the book he's looking for
can't be in the first half.

01:49.600 --> 01:53.000
So by making one query,
he's eliminated half of the books in the library.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.800
He may be slow, but he's intelligent.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.600
Spencer seems to have almost finished
his first shelf of books.

02:02.600 --> 02:06.200
He's got a few thousand more to go though
before he finds the right book.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.400
It's a bit like if he took
one of the world's fastest computers,

02:08.400 --> 02:12.400
and gave it one of the world's worst algorithms.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.800
Imagine if a fast engine like Google
returned results to you by searching through

02:15.800 --> 02:19.800
every page on the internet one by one.

02:19.800 --> 02:23.200
Now back to Slade, how are you going Slade?

02:23.200 --> 02:28.000
SLADE: Exactly as I planned. I narrowed it down,
and it should be on this shelf.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.400
You already know the book is on this shelf?

02:31.400 --> 02:33.200
SLADE: This half of the shelf

02:33.200 --> 02:34.600
BOZO: Excuse me!

02:34.600 --> 02:37.000
Bozo?, are you searching for the book as well?

02:37.000 --> 02:39.200
BOZO: Yep! I'm doing a Bozo Search.

02:39.200 --> 02:44.600
How does that work?
BOZO: Well, I take a book,
and hopefully it's the right book.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.400
But what if it isn't the right book?

02:46.400 --> 02:51.200
BOZO: Well then, I'll go and look for another book.
Excuse me.

02:51.200 --> 02:53.000
SLADE: Here it is!

02:53.000 --> 03:00.200
Congratulations Slade, you've won!
Guys you can stop searching now.Guys.

03:00.200 --> 03:03.400
Slade's found the book.

03:03.400 --> 03:07.400
Guys you can stop searching now.
Slade's won.

03:07.400 --> 03:13.000
Guys. Guys you can stop now.
[sigh]

03:13.800 --> 03:16.600
So it looks like the algorithm you choose
can make a big difference,

03:16.600 --> 03:18.600
particularly with large amounts of data.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.800
You see, if the library had been twice the size,
it would take Speedy Spencer

03:21.800 --> 03:27.200
twice as long to find the book. But Slowcoach Slade
would have only needed to check one extra book.

03:27.200 --> 03:30.200
In this chapter, we'll be looking more
at what algorithms are used for,

03:30.200 --> 03:32.600
and why it's important to choose the right one.

03:32.600 --> 03:37.200
So Slowcoach Slade, if you were an algorithm
in a program I was writing.

03:37.200 --> 03:41.000
I would be the happiest programmer alive.

03:42.700 --> 03:45.700
Algorithms

03:47.600 --> 03:52.000
SPENCER: Yes! Found it
Bozo? What are you reading?

03:52.000 --> 03:56.800
BOZO: Oh, it's a book on Metaginetics
in Argentina and Peru.

03:56.800 --> 03:59.400
SPENCER: Hmm, close enough.
