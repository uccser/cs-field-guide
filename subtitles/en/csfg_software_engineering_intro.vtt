00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Software Engineering

00:02.000 --> 00:04.400
Software is essential to our lives.

00:04.400 --> 00:09.800
Imagine living without the internet,
Google, Facebook or your smartphone

00:09.800 --> 00:12.200
We expect our software to work correctly.

00:12.200 --> 00:15.600
A bug in a program can make it
really frustrating to use,

00:15.600 --> 00:19.400
or it could even crash your computer.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.800
But it could also be a lot worse than that.

00:21.800 --> 00:24.800
What if the software controlling
a nuclear power plant fails?

The next section has been broken up to make different
combinations of subtitles appear at the same time

00:24.800 --> 00:29.200
Or the software controlling an aeroplane?
[Screams]

00:29.200 --> 00:31.600
Fortunately, Software Engineering techniques
[Screams]

00:31.600 --> 00:36.600
can help us make software that works correctly.
[Yay]

end of section

00:36.600 --> 00:41.600
Making good software is difficult
because often software is huge and complex.

00:41.600 --> 00:45.000
Some large systems have
tens of millions of lines of code.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.200
If you printed them out on paper
and stacked them like a book,

00:48.200 --> 00:51.200
You'd get a stack that is
around a hundred meters high.

00:51.200 --> 00:54.600
That's as high as a 25 storey building.

00:54.600 --> 00:59.000
If you wanted to read through a program that size,
to try to understand how it works,

00:59.000 --> 01:02.200
It's likely to take you about 50 years!

01:02.200 --> 01:05.400
If some software takes almost a lifetime
just to read through,

01:05.400 --> 01:07.800
imagine how long it would take to write it.

01:07.800 --> 01:13.000
Of course no single person can do this alone.
We need teams of developers working on software.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.600
Sometimes three developers,

01:14.600 --> 01:16.200
sometimes ten developers,

01:16.200 --> 01:19.400
sometimes a hundred,
and sometimes more.

01:19.400 --> 01:21.800
This is where Software Engineering comes in.

01:21.800 --> 01:25.200
How do we get a team of developers
to write huge software,

01:25.200 --> 01:30.200
where all the pieces fit together,
it works reliably, and it does what the user wants.

01:30.200 --> 01:33.800
Software Engineering is about
so much more than just programming.

01:33.800 --> 01:39.600
In fact, the actual programming part
is usually only about 20% of software projects.

01:39.600 --> 01:43.400
Even today we are not good
at getting software development right.

01:43.400 --> 01:48.000
A survey in 2009 found that only
around a third of software projects succeeded.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.400
While a quarter of projects failed outright,

01:50.400 --> 01:53.600
or were cancelled before
the software could be delivered.

01:53.600 --> 01:58.200
Fortunately we now know a lot
about what works and what doesn't.

01:58.200 --> 02:02.000
In this chapter, we'll look at
some approaches that are doomed to failure,

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
but are still used surprisingly often.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.400
And some approaches that seems to work a lot better,
and can helps us create software

02:08.400 --> 02:11.000
that does what it's meant to.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
