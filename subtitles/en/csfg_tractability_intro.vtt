00:00.000 --> 00:02.400
Tractability

00:03.000 --> 00:06.800
I've got four party invites to deliver to four friends,

00:06.800 --> 00:09.300
and I've worked out the best way of delivering them.

00:09.300 --> 00:11.500
I calculated how long it would take to visit:

The next section transitions very rapidly so could be difficult to read.
The names Alice, Bob, Carol and David have been shortened to
persons A,B,C and D

00:11.500 --> 00:13.000
friend A then B then C then D;

00:13.000 --> 00:14.800
or B, A, C, D;

00:14.800 --> 00:16.400
or A, B, D, C;

00:16.400 --> 00:18.000
or B, A, D, C;

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
or A, C, B, D.

end of section

00:20.000 --> 00:22.400
[sigh] You get the idea.

00:22.400 --> 00:26.600
With four friends there are 24 orders I would have to try.

00:26.600 --> 00:29.400
I considered inviting my fifth friend,

00:29.400 --> 00:33.200
but that would mean there was 120 different combinations I'd have to try,

00:33.200 --> 00:35.200
so she didn't get invited.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.200
I actually have 35 friends,

00:37.200 --> 00:38.800
but to invite them all I'd have to try

00:38.800 --> 00:42.600
ten thousand million million million
million million million (rounded)

00:42.600 --> 00:44.200
different combinations.

00:44.200 --> 00:49.600
In fact, if a dinosaur had started this calculation
using the fastest computer currently available,

added 'currently' in the above line for clarity

00:49.600 --> 00:52.800
it would still only be a fraction of a percent
complete today.

00:52.800 --> 00:58.400
Also, by the time the sun dies out,
it will still only be 1% complete.

00:58.400 --> 01:02.800
The trouble is that there are many important problems
in Computer Science that are difficult,

01:02.800 --> 01:04.800
and nobody's found out a good way of programming,

changed 'there is' to 'there are' in above line

01:04.800 --> 01:07.600
such as: cutting shapes out of material;

01:07.600 --> 01:10.200
loading freight onto trucks in the optimal way;

01:10.200 --> 01:12.600
working out timetables;

01:12.600 --> 01:15.000
even solving large Sudoku puzzles.

not sure what was said between 'Solving' and 'Sudoku',
'large' is my best guess

01:16.400 --> 01:20.000
It's also a good thing that these problems exist,
here's an example:

01:20.000 --> 01:22.400
Most internet security is based on Security Keys,

01:22.400 --> 01:25.400
which are a product of two large prime numbers,

01:25.400 --> 01:28.600
which will take billions of years
to figure out the factors of.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.800
If you don't believe me, try this:

01:30.800 --> 01:34.000
The number I'm displaying on the screen
is a product of two prime numbers.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.800
If you can work out what the
two factors of this number are,

01:36.800 --> 01:39.600
send us a message, and we will send you a free T-shirt.

01:39.600 --> 01:44.200
Computer Scientists don't even know if there are
better ways of finding the optimal solution.

01:44.200 --> 01:48.800
In the meantime the focus is just on calculating
good enough solutions.

01:49.600 --> 01:54.800
Or, you could just invite four friends to your party.

01:56.400 --> 01:59.000
