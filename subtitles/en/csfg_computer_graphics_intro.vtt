Computer Graphics is used to create all sorts of images.

00:06.200 --> 00:10.600
But at the end of the day they're just
pixels that have been given a certain colour value.

00:10.600 --> 00:13.000
Computer Scientists who work in Computer Graphics

00:13.000 --> 00:15.400
work out how to take an object,

00:15.400 --> 00:19.000
do some calculations and translate that
to a computer screen.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
For example: we need to think about an object's rotation;

00:24.600 --> 00:27.000
its position in 3D space;

00:32.000 --> 00:33.600
and its size. [quack]

00:33.600 --> 00:38.000
This also involves specifying colours mathematically,

00:38.600 --> 00:44.000
and working out what objects should
appear in front of others.

00:45.600 --> 00:50.000
And how to add shadows, and reflections.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
Even working out which pixels to use
to draw a circle, or a line

00:58.000 --> 00:59.800
isn't that simple.

00:59.800 --> 01:01.600
In this chapter, we're going to look at

01:01.600 --> 01:04.200
some of the challenges
and some of the calculations needed

01:04.200 --> 01:06.000
to get the right pixels

01:06.600 --> 01:08.400
in the right places

01:09.200 --> 01:12.000
on the screen.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.800
